\begin{frame}{Loss-based vs Delay-based}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Loss-based} strategies modify the increase/decrease parameters
		      in order to become more aggressive. Pitfalls:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item an aggressive behavior
				      causes more packet losses on bottleneck links;
				\item the throughput of the regular TCP flows is pushed back.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Delay-based} strategies
		      base their decisions on
		      RTT variations (e.g. \textit{FAST-TCP}). They have:
		      \begin{enumerate}
		         \item higher utilization;
		         \item less self-induced packet losses;
		         \item better RTT fairness and stabilization.
		      \end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
