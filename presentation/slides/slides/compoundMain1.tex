        \begin{itemize}
		\item Pure delay-based approaches are not competitive to
		      loss-based approaches.
		\item This happens because they reduce their sending rate
		      when bottleneck queue is built. However, this behavior will make
		      loss-based flows increase their sending rate since they
		      notice less packet losses.
