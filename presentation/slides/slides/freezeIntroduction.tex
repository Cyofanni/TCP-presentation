\begin{frame}{Previous approaches}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Many approaches involve base stations in flow and congestion control. Besides, they
    often split the connection (\textit{I-TCP}, \textit{M-TCP}, \textit{Snoop} etc...).

    \item \textbf{Freeze-TCP} is an end-to-end scheme and doesn't require the involvement of any
        intermediaries for flow control.
    \item In order to achieve \textit{Freeze-TCP}'s goals, changes in TCP code don't go beyond the mobile
          client.
