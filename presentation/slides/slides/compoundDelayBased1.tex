        \begin{itemize}
		\item A state variable (\texttt{baseRTT}) is maintained as
		      an estimation of the delay of a packet over the
		      network path.
		\item A the start of a connection, \texttt{baseRTT} is updated
		      to the minimal observed RTT.
		\item An exponentially smoothed current RTT (\texttt{sRTT}) is also maintained.
