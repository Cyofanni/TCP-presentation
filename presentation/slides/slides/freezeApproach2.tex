       \begin{itemize}
		\item How much in advance of the disconnection should the receiver advertise a window size of zero?
		\item There should be a \textit{warning period} prior to disconnection.
		\item They figured out that a sensible choice is the \textit{Round-Trip-Time}:
	           \begin{enumerate}
			\item if it is too long, there will be idle time
			      prior to the disconnection;
			\item if it is too small, the sender's window could
			      drop due to packet losses.
		   \end{enumerate}
       \end{itemize}
