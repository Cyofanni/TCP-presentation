		\item When the receiver advertises a zero-size window,
		      the sender enters the \textbf{persist mode}:
		      \begin{itemize}
			    \item \textit{Zero Window Probes} are sent
				  until the receiver's window opens up;
			    \item eventually, the receiver sends back a non-zero window size,
				  and the sender will open its sending window.
