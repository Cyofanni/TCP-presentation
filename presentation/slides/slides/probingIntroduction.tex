\begin{frame}{Improving energy efficiency}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Energy efficiency is becoming paramount
		      in communication protocols (a cross-layer issue).
		\item The error control mechanism should
		      be friendly both to \textbf{throughput} and \textbf{low power consumption}.
		\item Energy-conserving capabilities in standard TCP: \newline
		      after segment drops, it shrinks the window so as to
		      save transmission effort.
