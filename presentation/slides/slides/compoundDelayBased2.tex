\begin{frame}{Delay-based component design (2)}
        The number of backlogged packets can
	be estimated by means of these formulas:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \texttt{expected = win / baseRTT};
			\item \texttt{actual = win / RTT};
			\item \texttt{diff = (expected - actual) * baseRTT}.
		\end{enumerate}
	An early congestion is detected if the number of packets in the queue is larger
	than a fixed threshold $\gamma$ ($diff > \gamma$).
\end{frame}
