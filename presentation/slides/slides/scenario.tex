\begin{frame}{Scenario}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{TCP} wasn't designed to cope with mobility issues and high-speed networks.
		\item Several enhancements to standard TCP have been devised:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item mobility and power consumption is now taken into account (\textit{I-TCP}, \textit{M-TCP}, \textit{Freeze-TCP});
			\item some enhancements tackle problems posed by high-speed and long-distance networks
			      (\textit{FAST TCP}, \textit{Compound TCP}).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
