\begin{frame}{The Compound TCP (4)}
        \begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{Sending window = min(cwnd + dwnd, awnd)}.
		\item The \texttt{cwnd} is updated in the same way as in
		      regular TCP's congestion avoidance.
		\item The \textit{Slow-Start} behavior of regular TCP is kept at
		      the start-up of a new connection. In fact,
		      \textit{Slow-Start} is quick
		      enough also for fast and long distance environments.
		\item The delay-based component comes into play
		      in the congestion avoidance phase.
        \end{itemize}
