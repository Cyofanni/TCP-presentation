\begin{frame}{Probe Cycle (2) - Implementation}
   \begin{enumerate}
	\item  The sender transmits \textit{PROBE1}, to which the receiver
    	       immediately responds with \textit{PR1_ACK}. After receiving
	       the latter the sender transmits \textit{PROBE2}.
  	\item  The receiver acknowledges this second probing
	       with a \textit{PR2_ACK} and returns to the \textit{ESTAB} state.
  	\item  A critical part of the probing mechanism is the
    	       protocol's behaviour at the end of the cycle.
