\begin{frame}{The Compound TCP (2)}
        \begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Compound TCP} incorporates a scalable delay-based component
		      into the standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithm.
		\item Delay-based component's features:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item rapid window increase
		      	 	      rule when the network is under-utilized;
		      		\item it reduces the sending rate once the bottleneck queue is
		      		      built.
			\end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}
