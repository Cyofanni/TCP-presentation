\begin{frame}{Improved Error Recovery for \newline better Energy Efficiency}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item The Error Recovery mechanism is not always efficient:
	      in fact, standard TCP thinks that packet losses always happen due to
	      \textit{congestion}.
	\item In case of \textit{infrequent} and \textit{transient} errors,
	      standard TCP strategy leads to:
	      \begin{enumerate}
	      	\item unneeded effective throughput degradation;
		\item increase in overall connection time.
	      \end{enumerate}
	\item Moreover, monitoring network conditions only by means of
	      packet losses causes major energy wastage.
    \end{itemize}
