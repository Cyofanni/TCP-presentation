		\item Standard TCP can't fully utilize
		      the network capacity because of its
		      conservative approach.
		\item In \textbf{Compound TCP},
		      \textit{delay-based} and \textit{loss-based}
		      approaches coexist.
		\item In \textit{Compound TCP}, a scalable delay-based
		      component is plugged into the
		      \textit{TCP Reno} congestion avoidance algorithm,
		      which is loss-based.
