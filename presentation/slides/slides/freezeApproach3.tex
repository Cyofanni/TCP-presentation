       \begin{itemize}
                \item A relevant issue: the \textit{ZWP}s are exponentially backed off,
			so there could be an idle time after a reconnection.
		\item Trick: soon after the reconnection, the receiver
		      sends 3 copies of the ACK for the last data segment
		      it received before the disconnection (\textbf{TR-ACKs}).
       \end{itemize}
